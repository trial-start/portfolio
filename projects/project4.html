        <p>
          The Keeper project is a modern and user-friendly note-taking
          application developed using React.js. It allows users to create, edit,
          and delete notes effortlessly. The app utilizes the useState hook to
          manage the state of the notes, ensuring seamless updates and
          rendering. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and visually
          appealing, with a header displaying the app name and a footer showing
          the copyright information. The main content area showcases the notes,
          with each note displaying its title and content. Users can easily
          delete a note by clicking the delete button associated with each note.
          The CreateArea component enables users to add new notes by providing a
          title and content. The app also features a date display that shows the
          current date. With its clean and responsive design, the Keeper app
          provides a delightful experience for organizing and managing notes.
