        <h2>To Do List</h2>
        <p>
          The ToDo list project is a simple and intuitive task management
          application built using React.js. It provides users with the ability
          to add, remove, and track their to-do items in an organized manner.
          The project leverages the useState hook to manage the state of the
          to-do items, ensuring seamless updates and rendering. The user
          interface consists of a user-friendly input area where users can add
          new tasks and a list that dynamically displays the added items. Users
          can click on an item to mark it as completed or delete it from the
          list. The project showcases the power of React.js in creating
          interactive and responsive applications. With its clean design and
          intuitive functionality, the ToDo list project offers an efficient and
          enjoyable way to manage tasks.
